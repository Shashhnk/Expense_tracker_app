A new Flutter project.

I have succesfully completed TASK 1 and 2 , 
for the 3rd task.


Task 3: Data Visualization with Pie Chart
Added fl_chart to create an interactive Pie Chart.

The Pie Chart dynamically displays category-wise expenses.

Displays category name, total amount, and icon dynamically.

Users can visually analyze their spending patterns easily.

I have added the app - expense-app.apk
